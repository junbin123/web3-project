# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

什么是 ABI？是应用二进制接口的缩写。您可以把它看作是客户端应用程序和 Ethereum 区块链之间的接口，在这里您将要与之交互的智能合同被部署。
